# Product Design: Homelab AI Services API

## Vision

A simple, ready-to-use AI service that lets developers add AI features to their applications without dealing with Python dependencies or ML infrastructure.

## Target Users

Homelab developers building applications in any language who need local AI capabilities but don't want to manage ML complexity.

## What We Provide

### AI Capabilities

**Image Understanding**
- Send an image, get a text description
- Use for: auto-tagging photos, accessibility features, content moderation

**Text to Vectors**
- Convert text into numerical representations for semantic search
- Use for: finding similar documents, recommendation systems, search enhancement

**Smart Web Scraping**
- Give a URL, get clean text content
- Handles modern JavaScript-heavy websites
- Optional screenshots for archival or testing

### User Interface

**Configuration Dashboard**
- Visual interface to manage which AI models are active
- See resource usage and service status
- Control which features are enabled
- No command-line expertise required

**API Explorer**
- Interactive documentation to test API calls directly
- Copy-paste code examples for your language
- See exactly what requests and responses look like

**Monitoring View**
- See which of your apps are using which AI features
- Track response times and error rates
- Understand resource consumption

### Developer Features

**Quick Integration**
- Simple REST API calls from any language
- Process multiple items in one request for efficiency
